This is a basic calculator written in the console, where a person can input 2 numbers on which operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division will be performed. The program includes some checks: if you divide by 0, the answer will be 0, and if you enter text instead of numbers, an error message will be displayed. Since everything is wrapped in a loop, you can use it indefinitely without having to restart the console.
